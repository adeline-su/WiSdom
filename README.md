# WiSdom
This is our uoft hacks 2023 project!
Since our team members began searching for summer internships, our weekends have been spent exploring the workforce and scouring for the faintest information on a companyâ€™s culture. Despiting seeing plenty about work hours and the overall atmosphere, there is little shared about the unique experiences and challenges women face while being a minority within STEM-based industries. Our team recognizes the lack of female-oriented resources for women entering STEM-based industries which is why we created WiSdom, a platform allowing Women in STEM to gain wisdom and confidence in their career choices.

WiSdom fosters an inclusive community for women in STEM through two key features:
- Explore their future workplaces
- Share their experiences
